# Nix Builder Dapp

This proof of concept allows you to run Nix build inside the Cartesi virtual machine.

We built Nix tools for riscv64 and installed them on the `cartesi/python:3.10-slim-jammy` image in order to create a reproducible build of a generic software given his depencencies. At the moment the docker image depends on a specific package that we are going to build (GNU hello).

## Interacting with the application

Build

```shell
docker buildx bake --load
```

```shell
docker compose -f ../docker-compose.yml -f ./docker-compose.override.yml up
```

Then to ensure that everything is up & running you can use the [frontend-console](../frontend-console) application to interact with the DApp.
Ensure that the [application has already been built](../frontend-console/README.md#building) before using it.

First, go to a separate terminal window and switch to the `frontend-console` directory:

```shell
cd frontend-console
```

Then, send an input as follows:

```shell
yarn start input send --payload "message"
```

In order to verify the notices generated by your inputs, run the command:

```shell
yarn start notice list
```

You will be able to get in response the Nix version installed on the docker image.
